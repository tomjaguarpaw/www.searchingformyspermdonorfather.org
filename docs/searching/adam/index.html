        <div id="main"><p>My name is Adam Quinlivan.</p>
<p>I didn't find out that I was a donor offspring until I was 25 years
old. This happened as a result of me seeing some medical documents
at my Mum's house and noticing that my Mum, sister and I all had a
different blood type. I mentioned this and before I could guess at
what Dad's blood type was, my Mum told me that I was donor
conceived.</p>
<p>I do remember while growing up that I wondered if I was adopted.
There was always something at the back of my mind about this.</p>
<p>My Mum told me as much as she could about it. She mentioned the
Voluntary Register, which is set up in Western Australia for donors
and donor offspring to get in contact with each other. I am
registered with this organisation though unfortunately they have had
no luck.</p>
<p>I have written a letter to the doctor, Dr. Colin Douglas-Smith, who
was the consultant for my parents. The doctor, who is now very
elderly, called me on the phone and told me a bit about what it was
like back in the 70's and about how there were no records kept. He
told me that the donors he used were "local boys" who were medical
students at the time.</p>
<p>At the time of my conception the doctor had his own practice, but
later he worked for an organisation. They now have all his records.
I also wrote to this organisation and they also rang me and said
they had none of his records from that far back.</p>
<p>I, along with another donor offspring, created a website called the
<a href="http://www.ausdcf.org">Australian Donor Conception Forum</a>. We
thought it would be a good to have something available on the
internet like an online forum, as this would allow people the chance
to chat to others and learn a bit more about how others have felt
and what they have gone through about donor issues. It is also an
easy way to view someone's picture if they so desire.</p>
