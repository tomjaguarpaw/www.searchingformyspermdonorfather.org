        <div id="main"><p>Damian was conceived through <strong>donor insemination</strong> in 1973 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia.</p>
<p>He is 6 foot tall (1.82m), slim build, with fair skin and light ginger hair.</p>
<p>Through having children of his own he was able to see the true importance of genetic ties and the role it plays in our lives. While he can understand the importance of bonds born through sociology, the holding
of one's own children in his arms made him infinitely aware that those bonds born through blood are unbreakable and of equal importance. He has sought to rectify this severed kinship for many years but the
lack of available records has hampered any searching. By finding his genetic father he will be able to repair his lost identity and provide a genetic heritage not only for himself but also for his own children
who have already started asking questions. It breaks his heart that he does not have the truth to give them.</p>
<p>What is known about his donor is that he was a medical student at the time and that his blood group would be A or AB. Without even realising, his genetics drove Damian into medical research after completing a
biotechnology degree at university.</p>
<p>There are many physical and personality traits that are not found on the other side of his family. These things need to be linked to a face, a name, a person.</p>
<p>Equally important to Damian is also the quest to find out about siblings through the donors own family as well as those that were the product of other donations.</p>
<p>He doesn't need another father or any type of financial connection, just the truth about his identity and heritage. This will enable him to repair what was donated away not just from himself, but also his
own children.</p>
<p>If you have any information that may help Damian, no matter how trivial it would be exceptionally gratefully received via e-mail: <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#121;&#102;&#97;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#45;&#50;&#48;&#49;&#53;&#64;&#106;&#97;&#103;&#117;&#97;&#114;&#112;&#97;&#119;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#121;&#102;&#97;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#45;&#50;&#48;&#49;&#53;&#64;&#106;&#97;&#103;&#117;&#97;&#114;&#112;&#97;&#119;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a></p>
