        <div id="main"><p>Jessica was <strong>conceived</strong> on July 31, 1981 at the <strong>Baylor College of Medicine</strong> using an <strong>anonymous sperm donor</strong>. The doctor was <strong>Ron Young, MD</strong> and his nurse was <strong>MaryAnn</strong>. Jessica's mother states the following regarding donor information. The donor was supposedly:</p>
<ul>
<li>A senior in medical school</li>
<li>5'8"</li>
<li>Green eyes</li>
<li>Light brown hair</li>
<li>Initials were R.B.</li>
<li>Jessica's mother remembers comments made about the donor by MaryAnn such as he was "reliable and healthy" (leading her to believe he might have been a "commonly used" donor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jessica is not sure these details are completely accurate. When Jessica spoke personally with Dr. Young, he was very discouraging and claimed all records from that time period had been destroyed. Jessica does
not know of any half siblings but assumes they exist.</p>
<p>Jessica's mother was always honest with her about her conception, so she has known she was donor conceived since early childhood. She was always repeatedly told she would never be able to know who her
biological father is, but she still hopes they might someday connect. Jessica does not have an interest in attempting a relationship with the donor if he has no desire to do so. She is also not interested in
any sort of financial contributions. She would, however, like information regarding her heritage and medical history, and she would also enjoy learning about personality traits and likes/dislikes she and her
donor might share. Jessica is open to establishing any mutually desired connections with potential half siblings.</p>
<p>Jessica is 5'5" with very curly light brown hair, a fair complexion, and hazel eyes (they seem to change between green and brown). She is naturally inclined to the arts, writing, etc. (She wishes she was more
inclined towards math and sciences!) She has a Bachelor of Arts in English. She is an animal lover, especially of dogs. She also loves baking and craft projects.</p>
<p>If you have any information at all that might help Jessica with her search for her donor or half siblings, please contact her at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#101;&#98;&#101;&#108;&#51;&#50;&#49;&#64;&#121;&#97;&#104;&#111;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#106;&#101;&#98;&#101;&#108;&#51;&#50;&#49;&#64;&#121;&#97;&#104;&#111;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>
