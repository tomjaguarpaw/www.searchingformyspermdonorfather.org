<p>Ruth was conceived at the Jessop Hospital For Women in Sheffield in the summer of 1983, and born 3/4/1984.</p>
<p>The doctor there was called Dr Pennington, and the nurse Sister White.  Her mother thinks that the donation on this occasion was fresh and not frozen.</p>
<p>She found out about her conception when she was about 8 as she had been 
with her mother to a hospital in Leeds when she was trying to conceive again and was fascinated by reproductive medicine.  After coming home 
and watching a programme about "special babies", she was told.</p>
<p>Many of Ruth's hobbies and interests have yet to be realised. She intends to travel more, learn to play the piano and do a midwifery degree, but for now
is proud to be an almost full time mother to a two-year-old son and four-year-old daughter who keep her very busy.</p></div>
