Sports
======

Tom is a keen sportsman and an avid fan of football.  Tom's main sport is
badminton, and he's a member of his university's badminton squad.  As a
sportsman he is determined and always tries his
hardest to win.

Here's Tom on court:

Every year there is a badminton dinner for the players of the club.  Here
are some pictures:

Tom also likes playing football and watching on TV:

and is a wicket keeper in the cricket team due to quick reactions and safe
catching hands (Tom on the bottom far right):

Tom is also a player of tennis, and has played Ultimate frisbee for his
university too.

Academia
========

Tom graduated in Mathematics in 2005 and has continued with postgraduate
work since.

Here is Tom at his graduation lunch with friends, and with his mother:

Music
=====

Tom loves listening to dance music, jazz and classical music.  He doesn't play the piano
or violin anymore but he's a DJ and plays trance, house and drum & bass.

<a href='/static/user-images/tom/dj.jpg'><img alt='' src='/static/user-images/tom/thumbs/dj.jpg'></a>

Tom was a DJ on the university radio station with a good friend, and acted as a trainer to teach other people to become DJs on the radio station.

Languages
=========

Tom is fascinated by foreign languages and likes to learn the basic
structure of a lot of different languages.  After learning French and German
at school he travelled to Mexico to pick up Spanish, and improved it when
visiting Barcelona.  He's also interested in Portuguese, Italian and
scandinavian languages.

Here's Tom in Mexico:

During the summers 2007-2009 his improvised comedy troupe performed at the Edinburgh
fringe festival with impressive audience sizes.
